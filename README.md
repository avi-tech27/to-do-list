## Live Demo

Check out the live demo of the app [here](https://to-do-list-avinash-gupta.vercel.app/).

## Features

- Add new tasks with a title, description, priority, and due date.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Edit existing tasks.
- Delete tasks.
- Filter tasks based on priority or completion status.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

## Few points to mention
This is written purely on plain javascript hence no other library is used except bootstrap.

If I were to use frontend libraries/frameworks, then React.js would be my choice due to its component-based architecture, strong ecosystem, and excellent state management capabilities.
Choosing React.js for this project would have made development easier and more organized. With React's component-based structure, we could break down the UI into reusable parts, making changes and updates smoother. Managing tasks' states, like marking them as completed or editing details, would be simpler with React's state management tools. Plus, React's efficient rendering through the virtual DOM would ensure a smoother user experience. Leveraging React's ecosystem and libraries would also save time and effort, allowing us to focus more on enhancing the app's functionality and user interface
